# Command-line input format specification

**overreact** is both a library and a command-line application. In this
subsection, we briefly describe the minimal input specification for the
command-line application for doing first-principles microkinetic simulations.
Don't worry, the input is very simple, yet flexible.

<!-- TODO: cite this docs in the paper: "Further guidance and advanced usage information is available in the online documentation (\hrefdoc)". -->

Basically, **overreact** parses complex reaction schemes with the help of a
[domain-specific language (DSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
designed to be as flexible and intuitive as possible to any chemist. For
instance, as a purely illustrative example, the following
[Curtin-Hammett system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtin%E2%80%93Hammett_principle),

<!-- CITE 10.1021/jo00404a002 ? -->

\\[ \require{mhchem} \ce{ P\_{A}(w) <- [A(w)]^{\ddagger} <- A(w) <=> B(w) ->
[B(w)]^{\ddagger} -> P\_{B}(w) } \\]

could be modelled very easily as follows (saved, say, in a `curtin_hammett.k`
file):

```
// This is a comment and is ignored by overreact.

$scheme
 // Here we define our reactions.
 A(w) <=> B(w)
 A(w) -> A‡(w) -> P_A(w)
 B(w) -> B‡(w) -> P_B(w)
$end

$compounds
 // Here we specify the files for all species.
 A(w):   A@water.out
 B(w):   B@water.out
 A‡(w):  A_TS@water.out
 B‡(w):  B_TS@water.out
 P_A(w): P_A@water.out
 P_B(w): P_B@water.out
$end
```

## Some things to note

-   `//` indicates a **comment**. They are ignored until the end of the line.
-   **Blank lines** are also ignored.
-   Two **blocks** are required: the `$scheme` block and the `$compounds` block.
-   `$end` indicates the **end of a block**. It is optional: opening a new block
    closes the previous one.
-   **Compound labels** are case-sensitive. They must start with a letter but
    can contain any character except spaces. _Labels in the `$scheme` block
    should match the ones in `$compounds`_.
-   **Stoichiometric coefficients** are specified as multipliers in front of the
    compound labels, e.g., `2 * A(w)`, `3 * A(w)`, etc.
    `A(w)` equivalent to `1 * A(w)`.
-   `->` means a **forward reaction** (listing first reactants, then products).
-   `<-` means a **backward reaction** (listing first products, then reactants).
-   `<=>` means an **equilibrium**. They are useful when one does not want
    separately model both forward and backward reactions. _Equilibria are
    assumed to be much faster than any other reaction in the scheme_.
-   `‡` indicates a **transition state**. _It is considered part of the compound
    label_. You can also use the easier-to-type `#` instead. That is, `A#(w)` is
    means the same thing as `A‡(w)`.
-   `(w)` indicates a **solvated context**. _It is considered part of the
    compound label_. It is used to identify whether a concentration correction
    should be applied. The default is `(g)`, which is understood as gas phase.
    _The actual string is currently ignored_: we could have written `A(aq)`,
    `A(l)` or even `A(dcm)` instead, with the same effect. _We might use solvent
    information in the future_.
-   **Paths to files** are relative to the directory where the model file is
    located.
-   The **order** of the species in the `$compounds` block is not important. The
    same applies to the order of the reactions in the `$scheme` block.

## Multiple reactions in a single line

We can get even closer to the original chemical notation, as **overreact**
accepts multiple reactions in a single line. As such, the following is a
`$scheme` block equivalent to the one above:

```
$scheme
 P_A(w) <- A‡(w) <- A(w) <=> B(w) -> B‡(w) -> P_B(w)
$end
```

## Multiple logfiles for a single compound

You can provide multiple logfiles for a single compound.
This will read the files one by one, updating the data of the previous one
with the next.
As such, data present on the first file only (e.g., harmonic frequencies) will
be preserved, while data shared between files will be overridden by the subsequent files
(e.g., electronic energies).
This way **overreact** allows for mixed levels of theory in a very simple way:

```
$compounds
$compounds
 AcOH(g):  // acetic acid in gas phase
  logfile=UM06-2X/6-311++G(d,p)/acetic_acid.out
  logfile=DLPNO-CCSD(T)/cc-pVTZ/acetic_acid.out 
$end
```

## Extra symmetries

You can provide extra information about the symmetry of a compound to **overreact** with the `symmetry` keyword.
This is useful in cases such as
extra degrees of freedom in weakly-bound complexes
or unusually degenerate reaction paths (e.g., a nucleophile being able to attack from both faces of a functional group).

```
$compounds
 H3CHCl‡:
  logfile=H3CHCl‡.out
  symmetry=4
$end
```

Observe that this value will *multiply* the symmetry number found
by **overreact**.
You can use floating-point numbers to express fractions too!

## Some illustrative examples

1. A simple model for the
   [synthesis of ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haber_process):

```
$scheme
 // Synthesis of ammonia (notice how flexible the DSL is)
 3 * H2(g) + N2(g) -> TS#(g) -> 2 * NH3(g)

$compounds
 // Paths to the files for the species (notice $end is optional)
 H2(g):  h2.out
 N2(g):  n2.out
 TS#(g): ts.out
 NH3(g): nh3.out
```

2. A simple
   [Michaelis-Menten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics)-like
   scheme (with
   [competitive inhibition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_inhibition)):

```
$scheme
 // A simple Michaelis-Menten-like scheme
 C(aq) + S(aq) <=> CS(aq) -> CS‡(aq) -> C(aq) + P(aq)  // C(aq) is the catalyst

 // The inactivation of the catalyst is modeled as competitive inhibition
 C(aq) + I(aq) <=> CI(aq)
$end

$compounds
 C(aq):   c.out
 S(aq):   s.out
 CS(aq):  cs.out
 CS‡(aq): cs_ts.out
 P(aq):   p.out

 // Inactivation
 I(aq):   i.out
 CI(aq):  ci.out
$end
```
