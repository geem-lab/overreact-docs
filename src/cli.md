# Using **overreact** as a command-line tool

> **✏️** This an overview of the command-line tool. **If you're new to

Most commonly, you'll use the command-line tool to manage, explore and analyze
your microkinetic simulations. The following is a brief overview of options
available in the command-line tool. **You can access the full help page by
running `overreact --help`**. The output as of
[version 1.1.0](https://github.com/geem-lab/overreact/releases/tag/v1.1.0)
will be something similar to the following:

```console
$ overreact --help

                        (default: 1e-11)
```

The following is a brief description of the most commonly used options:

## The path to the model input file

The command-line tool requires the path to either a model source file (`.k`) or
a compiled one (`.jk`), from which it will read the given logfiles and calculate
all the thermodynamic and kinetic quantities of interest.

> **💡** [Click here](./input.md) to learn all about the **syntax of the model
> source file format**.

> **⚠️** **overreact** compiles your model (i.e., generates `.jk` files from the
> `.k` ones you've written) and tries to use the compiled ones whenever they are
> available. **If you want to force recompilation of the source file (e.g., your
> `.k` has changed), you can use the `--compile` or `-c` option (see below).**

## Initial concentrations

All the remaining positional arguments are considered initial concentrations of
compounds in the model. They are given in the form `name:quantity`, where `name`
is the name of a compound (defined in the model source file) and `quantity` is
the number of moles of that compound per liter of the working fluid (i.e.,
**concentrations are given in moles per liter**).

If at least one initial concentration is given, a microkinetic simulation will
be performed, and the concentrations of the model species at the end of the
simulation will be printed to the standard output.

> **⚠️** Kinetic profiles (e.g., plots of concentrations as a function of time)
> won't be produced by default. **You should use the `--plot` option in order to
> produce kinetic profiles (see below).**

## Produce kinetic profiles 📈

The `--plot` flag can be used to produce kinetic profiles (e.g., plots of
concentrations as a function of time during the microkinetic simulation).

You can either plot **all the species** (`--plot=all`) or only the **active
ones** (i.e., the ones that actually change concentration during the simulation,
up to a reasonable threshold, `--plot=active`) or a **single compound** of
interest (`--plot="NH3(w)"`).

## Energetics, kinetics and bias correction

The flags `--temperature` (or `-T`) and `--pressure` can be used to set the
working **temperature and pressure**, respectively, to be used in all
thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Units are in kelvins and pascals,
respectively, and the default values are 298.15 K and 101.325 kPa.

The `--qrrho` flag can be used to enable or disable the **quasi-rigid rotor
harmonic oscillator** (QRRHO) approximations for entropies
([_Theory. Chem. Eur. J._, **2012**, 18: 9955-9964](https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201200497)))
and enthalpies
([_J. Phys. Chem. C_ **2015**, 119, 4, 1840–1850](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jp509921r))).
The default value is `both`, which means that both entropies and enthalpies will
be corrected, but you can also choose to only enable the correction for
entropies (`--qrrho=entropy`) or only for enthalpies (`--qrrho=enthalpy`), or to
disable the correction altogether (`--qrrho=none`).

**Quantum tunneling approximations** can be selected or disabled with the
`--tunneling` flag. The default value is `eckart` (for the Eckart model), and
other valid options are `--tunneling=wigner` (Wigner model) and
`--tunneling=none` (no tunneling correction).

A **bias energy** (in kilocalories per mole) can be added to the model to
mitigate eventual systematic errors by using `--bias` (or `-b`). This will add a
constant energy value to each individual compound in the model. This is zero by
default.

> **⚠️** You should probably have a good reason to add a bias energy correction
> to your model.

## Force recompilation of the source file

The `--compile` (or, equivalently, `-c`) option forces the recompilation of the
source file (`.k`) into a compiled (`.jk`) model input file. **This is useful if
you want to make sure you're using the latest version of the source file.**

<details>
    <summary style="cursor: pointer;">
        🤔 Why doesn't overreact recompile my model automatically?
    </summary>
    <p>
        This is a design decision. The reason is that overreact is designed
        to work with <strong>very large models</strong>,
        and they can be slow interpret
        (imagine a model with a lot of reactions and a lot of species;
        <strong>overreact</strong> would have to read every logfile every time you run it,
        which can be quite slow).
    </p>
</details>

## Tuning the integrator

Some options are available to tune the integrator used in solving the
microkinetic ODE system:

- The `--method` flag can be used to specify the **integrator** to be used
  (possible values are `Radau`, `BDF` and `LSODA`). The default is `Radau`.
- The `--rtol` and `--atol` flags can be used to override the default
  **relative and absolute local errors** of the ODE system integrator (the
  default values are \\(10^{-5}\\) and \\(10^{-11}\\), respectively, which can
  be given in scientific notation as `--rtol=1e-5` and `--atol=1e-11`).
- The `--max-time` flag can be used to specify the **maximum microkinetic
  simulation time** (in seconds) allowed (the default is 86400 seconds, or one
  day)

Take a look at the
[documentation of the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html)
for low-level details on the integrator options.
